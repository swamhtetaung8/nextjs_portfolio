                <strong>24 years old full-stack developer</strong> from Myanmar,
                currently living and working in Thailand. I studied Computer
                Science for three years, but had to pause and leave the country
                due to the military coup (it wasn&apos;t easy). I&apos;m now continuing my
                studies online at the University of the People while working
                full-time as a developer.

                My love for tech started with gaming and evolved into wondering
                how different tech devices work. I began my dev career with <strong>PHP
                & Laravel</strong>, and eventually got into frontend frameworks like{" "}
                <strong>React</strong> (my favorite), <strong>Vue</strong>, and{" "}
                <strong>Angular</strong>. I&apos;m also comfortable with server
                setups, Linux administration, and managing deployments. I take
                ownership of what I build and care deeply about clean, scalable
                code. I enjoy hybrid work setups, collaborative
                teams, and learning something new every week.

                I focus a lot on <strong>work-life balance</strong> and believe that life outside work to balance the mental demands of development is important. So you will find me playing video games, watching anime and spending quality time with my family and friends in my leisure time. I also love to travel and my goal is to explore and settle in Europe in the next few years.
